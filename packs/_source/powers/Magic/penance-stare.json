On a Fantastic success, the target takes double damage and is paralyzed for one round. Characters with the Heroic tag take half the listed damage from this power in either case. If a target is shattered by this power, they can recover, but they come back in one of two ways. Either they are cleansed of their sins and ready to make a new start with a clean slate, or their emotions are drained from them permanently. How this works in each case is up to the Narrator.",
