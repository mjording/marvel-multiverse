To attempt this, they must be able to touch the dead target's body. and that body must be relatively intact-at least snough so that if the person came back to life they couldn't instantly die again. The character makes an Ego check against a TN equal to 10 plus 1 for every hour the target has been dead. For example, if the target has been dead for four hours, the TN is 14. On a success, the target is restored to 1 Health. On a Fantastic success, the target is restored to full Health. With any kind of success, the character using this power is then reduced to 1 Focus. On a failure, they only bave to pay the minimum cost of 20 Focus."
