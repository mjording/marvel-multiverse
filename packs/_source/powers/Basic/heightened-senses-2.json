    "effect": "The character can sense things roughly four times as far away as normal. Their senses are so sharp that they can use some of them to compensate for the loss of others (say, if blinded or deafened). They can even listen to the heartbeat of a person in the same room to see if they are lying-although this is as reliable as a traditional lie detector: far from 100% and not admissible in court. They also have a double edge on Vigilance checks to perceive things, and enemies have double trouble on checks they make to sneak past the character."
