    "description": "A rifle is a firearm designed to be fired from the shoulder, with a barrel that has a helical groove or pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the barrel walls. The raised areas of the rifling are called 'lands' which make contact with the projectile (for small arms usage, called a bullet), imparting spin around an axis corresponding to the orientation of the weapon. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile and prevents tumbling, in the same way that a properly thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of aerodynamically-efficient pointed bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy.",
