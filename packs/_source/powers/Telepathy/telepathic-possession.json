The character makes a Logic check with trouble against the target's Logic defense. On a success, the character takes over the target's body completely. The result of the character's check is the target number for any attempts by the target to end the possession. If the character attempts to harm someone with the possessed body, the target gets to make a Logic check to end the possession. If the target has the Heroic tag, they get an edge on the check. If the character attempts to harm the possessed body, the target gets an edge on the check. If the target has the Heroic tag, they get a double edge. This power can also be used to transfer the character's mind into an empty-minded target-like a fresh clone or android-permanently. This requires no check, as there is no one in the body to challenge the character's action.",
